# MongoDB $in Operator Issue with Null Values
This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `$in` operator in MongoDB queries with arrays containing `null` values.  The issue arises because MongoDB treats `null` differently than other data types within the `$in` operator.  This example showcases the problem and provides a solution.

## Problem
When an array used with the `$in` operator includes `null`, the query may not function as intended.  The `null` values in the array can prevent expected results from being returned.
